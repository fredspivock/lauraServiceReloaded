	"description": "<p>Penny Black Media is a distributor of independent feature films for the global airline market. They wanted a website to showcase their offerings in a new online format while retaining the familiarity of their brand identity. The site needed to allow their clients to easily find films in their ever-growing catalogue, and allow for both public and private access to film information and screeners. I provided this by continually tweaking and critiquing the design of the sitemap, wireframes and mockups until we were successful in providing an elegant and easy-to-use website.</p><p>By working closely with the Penny Black Media team in Southern California we solidified a relationship with another WPP company. After the unveiling of this new website Cathie Trotta, Managing Director for Penny Black Media, said <em>“Working with Spafax Interactive was a stimulating, collaborative experience. They successfully translated our vision into a look and feel that is perfectly on target with the Penny Black Media brand. We are more than pleased with our new website.</em>”</p>",
