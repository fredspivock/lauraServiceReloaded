	"description": "<p>I enjoy challenging web projects. Couple this with my love for design and you have a bona fide interaction designer. I have all the usual passions: good typography, content organisation, responsive interface design and usability. For the past three years I have put these to use while immersed in an interactive team at Spafax, a WPP-owned content marketing agency.</p><p>Watching how real people use websites is another passion of mine. Understanding a user’s experience helps me find potential problems in a site’s complex navigation system and create solutions early on. Frank Chimero says, “People ignore design that ignores people.” Frank has a good point.</p><h2>My Work Experience</h2><p>I started as a freelancer at Spafax &#8212; I was given simple tasks like designing infographics, social media campaigns, banner images for articles, and ads. It didn’t take long before those smaller tasks morphed into big projects. After a few months, the freelance gig was up, and I was hired as one of the few full-time designers at the company.</p><p>Soon after, I was designing websites from scratch for one of Spafax’s blue chip clients. These early encounters with UI/UX design were formative. I developed a fascination with the complex nature of designing for the browser. I enjoyed getting my hands dirty and being involved in the process, from ideation to testing, right through to deployment and beyond. It was a huge learning curve, filled with a lot of hard work, late nights, and teaching myself new skills to get the job done.</p><p>Contributing to pitches and conceptualizing projects for new and existing clients helped the department grow, and so did my responsibilities. I spearheaded multiple projects with tight deadlines and provided direction for new designers. This improved my ability to present and rationalize design decisions. At the same time, I was testing and learning new UI/UX tools and software on behalf of our growing department.</p><p>After three years of great work experience I have transitioned to working for myself. I want to continue developing great digital campaigns for interesting projects and companies. Making web products that work well, look amazing and are a delight to use is a priority for me. I am currently expanding my toolbox and learning Adobe After Effects and taking on more branding and identity projects. I am especially curious about designing mobile applications and ecommerce websites.</p><p>I would love to have a conversation about your project or hear about an open position at your company. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smervice\">Tweets</a> and <a href=\"mailto:laura.service1@gmail.com\">emails</a> are welcome!</p>",
